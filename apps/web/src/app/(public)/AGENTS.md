# Public route group

- Public pages may explain, enter or authenticate; they do not expose private business data or authorize mutations.
- External entry and return URLs are allowlisted intent only; they cannot carry credentials, roles, scopes or mutable server authority.
- Keep unauthenticated, unavailable and invalid-entry states distinct and avoid leaking private existence through error mapping.
